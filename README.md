# Passwords-Encrypter
A password encrypter that will save everything in a excel table

This encrypter will edit every letter of your password based in prime numbers previously generated based on the name of the service you chose, then it will save it in an excel table. It's important that you create a table similar to mine and that you write the service you want to generate a password for before running the code (I already wrote some of them).
